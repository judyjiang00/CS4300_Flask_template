According to Plato's ''Symposium'', it could hold an audience of 19,000 spectators. Aristophanes' ''The Clouds'', mocking Socrates, was first performed here, and Plato considered this play to be a contributing factor in Socrates' trial and execution.\\\\n\"), (u'Odeon of Herodes Atticus ', u'This theatre, built in 161 CE, is still used for concerts and plays. The stone backdrop is still preserved to a remarkable height of 3 stories, because it was incorporated into a later fortification on the site.\\\\n'), (u'Pnyx ', u'If Athens is the birthplace of democracy, then Pnyx is its cradle. Around 507 BC this rocky hill, overlooking the Akropolis, became the meeting place the \\'\\'ekklesia\\'\\', Athens\\' early democratic assembly. This site thus witnessed addresses by Pericles, Aristides and Alcibiades during the \\\\\"Golden Age\\\\\" of Athens, and had a capacity for 6000 to 13,000 hearers. The site was redesigned several times creating three distinct phases in its history, until the \\'\\'ekklesia\\'\\' moved to the Theatre of Dionysos some time during the first century BC. During the Roman era Pnyx was instead used as a sanctuary of Zeus.\\\\n'), (u'Ancient Agora ', u'The site of the Ancient Agora in a green space with a beautiful view of the Acropolis.

Also, catch the changing of the guards in front of the Parliament every hour on the hour. Their uniforms and walking style are very fun to see.

The lake stands at a 40 cm elevation. It continues deep inside the mountain in an underwater cave never fully explored, as its end seems impossible to trace even by employing sonar detection.
